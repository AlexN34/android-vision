OCRConverter
============

Adapted sample [Google Vision APIs sample](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/mobile-vision-ocr/) OCR Text reader to parse text as currency and convert to AUD.

Currently mostly hardcoded and ugly, but it works on printed text! 

TODO
------------
- Create configuration activity - pick currency to convert from/to, display current values for exchange rate
- Fetch exchange updates via API 
- Summary activity to save values on press, add notes and export to csv/googlesheets/something useful
- Stylise text HUD
- Explore Translation feature(s)?

Pre-requisites
--------------
 Android Play Services SDK level 26 or greater.
